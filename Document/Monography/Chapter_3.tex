As the spectral analysis is complicated cause the convective motion, I take an computational approach leading an observational requirement to lead the research.

\section{Methodology}
This research endeavor encompass both analytical and computational components. For the last part, the programming language Python and Jupyter Notebook was used.

The computational aspect focus on identifying the granulation pattern within the solar spectrum by calculating relative velocities using the wavelengths of Fe I. 

All analysis data and code used in the process will be uploaded to a GitHub repository, allowing anyone interested to reproduce the results and verify the authenticity of the conclusions presented. Moreover, proper credit will be given to all previous work from other researchers.
