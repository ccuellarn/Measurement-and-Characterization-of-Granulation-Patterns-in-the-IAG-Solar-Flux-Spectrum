In conclusion, this project characterized the convective blueshift in solar absorption lines and its dependence on both line depth and wavelength range.

Specifically, was produced a refined, blend-free list of Fe I lines and derived solar granulation patterns with minimal scatter. 
Also provided a detailed description of how the granulation pattern varies with wavelength, establishing a new, color-dependent standard curve.
