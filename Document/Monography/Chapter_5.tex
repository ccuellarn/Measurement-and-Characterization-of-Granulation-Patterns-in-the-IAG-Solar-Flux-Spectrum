In general, we conclude...
Characterize the convective blueshift of solar absorption lines and its dependence on line depth and wavelength range.

In specific, we produce a blend-free list of Fe I absorption lines and solar granulation patterns with minimal scatter.
We describe in detail how the granulation plot depends on wavelength range.
We explore possible explanations of wavelength-dependence and found thats () is the best.
We explore ways of dealing with the wavelength-dependence when using the solar spectrum as a gauge for stellar spectra.
