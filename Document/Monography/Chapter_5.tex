%Por cada objetivo va una conclusion
In conclusion, this project characterized the convective blueshift in solar absorption lines and its dependence on both line depth and wavelength range.

Specifically, was produced a refined, blend-free list of Fe I lines and derived solar granulation patterns with minimal scatter. 
Also provided a detailed description of how the granulation pattern varies with wavelength, establishing a new, color-dependent standard curve.

cONCLUSION FOR LINE DEPTH Wavelength DEPDENDENCE
Therefore, the wavelength shift is uniform in the disk-center spectrum; the wavelenght shift in the disk-flux spectrum shows the same behavior as the granulation curves; and for the infrared the tendency follows the IAG spatially resolves quiet sun atlas.
So this behavior is just for the disk flux, que nknow that the spectrm is affected by limb darkening, this can be concluded.
