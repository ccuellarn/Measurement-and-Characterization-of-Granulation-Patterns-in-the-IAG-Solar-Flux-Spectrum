As previously mentioned, David Gray has significantly advanced the study of granulation patterns in the solar photosphere, with a particular focus on measuring relative velocities with high precision.
This chapter explores the physical origins of the three signatures of convective motion in the Sun photosphere, and how this reveals the hydrodynamics on the outermost layer. 

\section{The solar interior and the solar outer atmosphere}

The Sun is classified as a yellow dwarf star of spectral type G2V.
Its chemical structure is primarily composed of a large fraction of ionized hydrogen and a smaller proportion of helium.
What makes the Sun unique in astronomical studies is its proximity to Earth, which allows for detailed observation unmatched for any other star.
Structurally, the Sun is divided into two main regions: The solar interior and the solar outer atmosphere. 

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Sun interior} the overall structure of the solar interior is core, radiative and convective zone. 
From the core, He nuclei is built from H nuclei in the proton-proton chain as Equation~\eqref{eq:pp chain} refers.
\begin{equation}
    4^{1} \text{H} \rightarrow ^4\text{He} +2e^++2\nu +26.7 \text{MeV} 
    \label{eq:pp chain}
\end{equation}
The proton-proton chain reaction in the core liberates approximately $26.7$  MeV of energy in the form of high energy $\gamma$-rays, and $0.5$  MeV of energy in the form of neutrinos. 
In this zone, standard models estimate a temperature of $1.6\times 10^7$  K and density to $1.6\times 10^5$  kg/$\text{m}^3$.
Moving outward through the layers, both the density and temperature decrease significantly, as the energy is slowly transferred outwards by radiative diffusion~\cite{Foukal_1990}.
This process progressively shifts the wavelength of the radiation from high energy $\gamma$-rays to the visible light that eventually escapes.
The large temperature combined with the high density, allows the absorptions and remissions of photons that make this zone highly opaque and maintain the central material in a plasma state, functioning like a massive nuclear reactor.

     \end{subfigure}

        \caption{The general structure of the Sun. Images modified from~\cite{Priest_1982}.}\label{fig:Sun structure}%
\end{figure}

On the other hand, Figure~\ref{fig:Sun outer atmosphere} illustrates the overall structure of the solar outer atmosphere consisting of the photosphere, chromosphere and corona. 
In these layers, the density decreases rapidly with height above the solar surface. 
However, the temperature decreases to a minimum of approximately $4300$  K in the upper photosphere before rising through the chromosphere and transition region to millions of degrees in the corona.
From that point, the temperature falls slowly expanding outwards as the solar wind. 

Nevertheless, the relevant layers for this project are the photosphere, a thin layer of plasma that emits most of the solar radiation; and the convection zone, in which all the convection process take place.
The radiation chain process from this target layers results on the emission of a continuous spectrum passes through the overlying chromosphere.
Then specific wavelengths are absorbed for this layer, resulting in the characteristic Fraunhofer lines superimposed on the emitted spectrum, which allows observing the convection consequences~\cite{Priest_1982}.

\section{The solar convection zone}

In 1885 Janssen obtained the first clear photograph of photospheric granules (see Figure~\ref{fig:Janssen photography}) providing the initial evidence and the starting point for numerous studies about granulation~\cite{Malherbe_2022}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{First take photosphere.jpg}
    \caption{The first clear photograph of the photosphere where the granulation pattern is visible took by Janssen in 1885. Image taken from~\cite{Malherbe_2022}.}\label{fig:Janssen photography}%
\end{figure}

Following the history, in 1930, Unsöld theorized that the layers beneath the photosphere should be convective unstable~\cite{Foukal_1990}. 
This hypothesis was later supported by Plaskett when he related the observed granules to the convective cells studied in Bénard's laboratory experiments~\cite{Plaskett_1936}.
In this analogy, a fluid heated from below develops rising elements of hot gas that transport heat to the surface.

The elements of hot gas rising transporting heat are called \textit{convective cells}, and the pattern generated by several cells on the photosphere is the \textit{granulation} with each individual region referred to as a \textit{granule}. 
Typical granules span approximately 700 km and have short lifetimes, lasting between five to ten minutes.

In the solar context, convection takes place in a highly compressible and stratified gas ubicated at approximately $0.86 R_{\astrosun}$ and affected by a large temperature gradient.
This physical regime leads to determine the conditions required for convection to occur and the resulting dynamics of the granules~\cite{Foukal_1990}. 

\subsection{The Schwarzschild criterion}
Consider an elementary parcel of material displaced in local hydrostatic equilibrium with its surroundings, characterized by radial profiles of pressure $P(r)$, density $\rho(r)$, and temperature $T(r)$.
If the granule temperature is increased to a value $T'$, it will expand adiabatically to maintain pressure equilibrium, thereby decreasing the density relative to its surroundings (see Figure~\ref{fig:parcel argument}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Parcel argument.jpg}
    \caption{Diagram for the parcel of material displaced so slowly that remains in horizontal pressure. Image taken from~\cite{Priest_1982}.}\label{fig:parcel argument}%
\end{figure}

This convective cell experiences a buoyancy force, causing it to rise. 
The buoyancy force persists until the granule's density matches that of its new surroundings after traveling a length $l$.
Let $T_n'$ be the temperature of the rising element and $T_n$ the temperature of its new surroundings. 
The difference between the adiabatic gradient of the element and the radiative gradient of the surroundings governs the convection, as described by Equation~\eqref{eq:adiabatic radiative gradients}
\begin{equation}
    T_n = T + \parens{\frac{dT}{dr}}_R l \quad \big| \quad T_n' = T' + \parens{\frac{dT}{dr}}_{ad} l
    \label{eq:adiabatic radiative gradients}
\end{equation}
Where $R$ refers for radiative temperature gradient and $ad$ for the adiabatic temperature gradient. 
The onset of convection leads to the inequality~\eqref{eq:radiative condition}, where two conditions can arise: The granulation is established when adiabatic gradient exceeds the radiative gradient; otherwise, the layer is stable and energy is transported by radiation.
\begin{equation}
    -\parens{\frac{dT}{dr}}_R > \parens{\frac{dT}{dr}}_{ad}
    \label{eq:radiative condition}
\end{equation}
If the granulation is established, the element continues to expand adiabatically as it rises, driven by buoyancy.
Otherwise, if the layer is stable, the element will contract, becomes heavier than its surroundings and begins to move down toward its original position.

This onset of instability, when the vertical temperature gradient is too large, is known as the Schwarzschild criterion for convection.
Conveniently this criterion is expressed in terms of the relation between $T$, $P$ and $\gamma$ (hear capacity ratio) for an adiabatic change (see Equation~\eqref{eq:Schwarzchild criterion}).

\begin{equation} 
    -\parens{\frac{dT}{dr}}_R  > \frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma} \parens{\frac{T}{P}}\parens{-\frac{dP}{dr}}_{ad}
    \label{eq:Schwarzchild criterion}
\end{equation}

In this form, the condition establish that convection can set when opacity rises rapidly, due to increasing the population of $n=3$ level of hydrogen and $\gamma$ lowered by ionization.
The material and energy transported by this process ended on the low photosphere, where the granules exhibit different properties that will be examined in subsequent sections.

\section{The Solar Photosphere} 
As mentioned in the previous section, the observation of this layer lead to the study of dynamics and reactions within Sun's outermost layer. 
From surface observations a distinct pattern of granules with dynamic behavior is apparent, where individual cells continuously emerge and disappear (see Figure~\ref{fig:photosphere visual}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{Granulation pattern.jpg}
    \caption{A view of granulation on the Sun's surface. Image taken from~\cite{Samir_pattern}.}\label{fig:photosphere visual}%
\end{figure}

The bright areas of granules correspond to regions where hot gas rises through the solar atmosphere.
As this gas releases energy in the form of photons at the photosphere, it cools and subsequently descends, creating the darker regions of intergranular lanes~\cite{Carroll_Ostlie_2006}.
Furthermore, high-resolution observations reveal that these granules are in continual motion generating asymmetries in absorption line profiles (see Figure~\ref{fig:motion granules}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Granules motion.jpg}
    \caption{A time sequence showing granule evolution where the time intervals are about a minute. Image taken from~\cite{Foukal_1990}.}\label{fig:motion granules}%
\end{figure}

\subsection{Static photosphere: Limb darkening phenomenon}

Because the temperature decreases outward through the photospheric layers, the observed intensity falls off towards the solar limb. 
Discovered by Halm in 1907~\cite{Dravins_1981}, this effect is known as \textit{limb darkening phenomenon}, which make the disk intensity profile to appear more squared at increasing wavelength (see Figure~\ref{fig:squared profile}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.55\linewidth]{Limb darkening.jpg}
    \caption{Squared profile for the disk intensity at increasing wavelengths, where $5\mu$ refers to the infrared range and $0.32\mu$ the violet range. Image taken from~\cite{Foukal_1990}.}\label{fig:squared profile}
\end{figure}

The analysis of this effect provides a direct technique for determining the temperature structure of the photosphere as a function of line depth. 

For typical weaker lines, the convective blueshift diminishes toward the limb, with a net velocity change approximately of $400$  m/s.
As explain Ellwarth et al.~observations closer to the limb pass through the atmosphere a shallower angle, resulting in longer optical paths through high atmospheric layers that allows the study of the layers where convective blueshift is less pronounced~\cite{Ellwarth_2023}.
Because of this phenomena and following the objective of study the line depth-dependence of convective blueshift, the center disk flux spectrum was taken as reference for analysis, where the limb darkening effect is neligible.

\subsection{Dynamic photosphere: The C-curved profile bisector.}
Analysis of changes, contrast and velocity field in the granulation structure have been inferred indirectly from observations of Fraunhofer line profile shapes~\cite{Foukal_1990}.
The observations on absorption lines reveals that velocity of a rising granule decays less rapidly than its excess brightness, resulting in a characteristic C-curved line profile bisector (see Figure~\ref{fig:c curved profile}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{C curved profile bisector.jpg}
    \caption{The C-curved line profile bisector with the corresponding diagram of wavelength displacement due to convective blueshift. Imagen taken from~\cite{Dravins_1981}.}\label{fig:c curved profile}%
\end{figure}

The formation of the C-curved line profile bisector occurs in three stages, corresponding to different heights in the photosphere.

First, the deepest part of the line profile is formed higher up, in a region of decelerated upflow, producing a smaller blueshift.
Then, the mid-depth portion is formed in the brightest upflowing material, resulting in a blueshift.
Finally, the line profile wings where the opacity is lowest, tend to be formed deepest in the cool material, producing a redshift.

This dynamic process induces characteristic asymmetries on the line profile bisector, which becomes the principal instrument to measure convection process from the solar atmosphere.

\section{The three signatures of convection}
The three signatures of convection in stars are described by Gray in his research (see~\cite{Gray_2009,Gray_Oostra_2018,Gray_Pugh_2012} and references therein) as the principal characteristics to identify and treat the asymmetries due to convective motion.

\subsection{First signature of convection: Line broadening} 

The absorption lines can be classified by decreasing intensity line profile as strongest and weakest lines~\cite{Gray_Pugh_2012}.


In general, stronger absorption lines exhibit more pronounced line core curvature than weaker lines.
However, the line core curvature is affected by different broadening effects due to Doppler, atomic and magnetic effects as we talk of the photosphere like a stratified hot gas with magnetic flux.
\textcolor{Miku}{IN PROGRESSS}

This line core curvature $C_c$ can be quantified by the second derivative of the line's intensity profile with respect to wavelength, evaluated at observed wavelength (see Equation~\eqref{eq:core curvature}).
\begin{equation}
    C_c =  \lambda_{obs}^2 \parens{\frac{d^2 p(\lambda_{obs})}{d \lambda_{obs}^2}}
    \label{eq:core curvature}
\end{equation}

In the near infrared range, the solar spectrum contains natural bands or groups of lines that are separated by regions of strong absorption from telluric elements. 
In other words, elements like $\text{O}_2$ and $\text{CO}_2$ that are absorbed by the atmosphere.
This phenomenon modify the line core curvature of determining lines profiles, specially in the near infrared range.


\textcolor{Miku}{IN PROGRESSS}
\subsection{Second signature of convection: Line profile asymmetry}
As demonstrated by Nieminen~\cite{Nieminen_2017}, the asymmetry occurs because the c-curved profile bisector reflects velocity variations and a bisector slope (see Figure~\ref{fig:asymmetries on lines}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Asymmetries on typical lines.jpg}
    \caption{Asymmetries on an average absorption line. Can be observed the differences in intensity redshift profile. Image taken from~\cite{Nieminen_2017}.}\label{fig:asymmetries on lines}%
\end{figure}

According to Kirchhoff's laws, absorption line formation requires lower temperature conditions, which are found precisely in the Sun's outermost atmospheric layers~\cite{Carroll_Ostlie_2006}. 
These regions not only provide the appropriate temperatures for absorption but also exhibit comparatively higher opacity. 
Those spectral lines from Fe I are particularly valuable for solar granulation studies due to their high abundance, minimal thermal broadening, limited isotopic variation and availability of accurate laboratory measurements of natural wavelengths~\cite{Nieminen_2017}. 

These asymmetries imprinted on the Fe I lines can be quantified by analyzing their bisectors. 
A convenient method for this measures involves using the third derivative of the line profile, which provides the slope of the lowest end of the bisector (see Equation~\eqref{eq:third derivative relation}). 
\begin{equation}
    -\frac{c}{\lambda_{obs}}\parens{\frac{1}{3 C_c^2}}\parens{\frac{d^3 p(\lambda_{obs})}{d \lambda_{obs}^3}}
    \label{eq:third derivative relation}
\end{equation}

The slope of the line profile is defined as zero when the line profile bisector is vertical and the line core is symmetric.
The relation is derived in appendix\ref{ap:third derivative}.

Since most of stellar observations are made with lower-resolution spectrographs and often lower signal-to-noise ratios, there is a need to study granulation through its signatures.
Gray and Oostra identified a form of line profile asymmetry observable under these conditions, known as the \textit{flux deficit}. 
This phenomenon can be interpreted as flux imbalances on the redshifted side of the line profile, caused by a net loss of radiative energy. 

To quantify this asymmetry, the authors proposed calculating the flux deficit by taking the difference between the observed, altered profile and a the granulation curve.
By treating the altered line profile as an approximate representation of the third signature of convection, one can observe the flux difference interpreted as radiation~\cite{Gray_Oostra_2018}.

\subsection{Third signature of convection: Line depth-dependent wavelength shifts}
Many studies across the years have detected and observed the phenomenon of wavelength shifts against the line depth, or as it is called, convective redshift.
This behavior was shown to be more present in the weaker lines which are related to infrared and violet range.

\subsection{Solar granulation pattern}
The solar granulation pattern is a plot of relative velocity against line depth, as shown Figure~\ref{fig:granulation pattern ellwarth}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{Granulation pattern Ellwarth.jpg}
    \caption{Granulation pattern for the IAG spatially resolved quiet sun atlas, is shown to have a strong blueshift in the weaker lines. Image taken from~\cite{Ellwarth_2023}.}\label{fig:granulation pattern ellwarth}%
\end{figure}

Notice in Figure~\ref{fig:granulation pattern ellwarth} the wavelength-dependence os the pattern.
The significance of the granulation pattern lies in its universality for solar-type stars; their patterns closely resemble the Sun's, differing primarily by a scaling factor (see~\cite{Gray_Pugh_2012}). 
Consequently, a detailed analysis contributes to the understanding and radiation of photospheric hydrodynamic models~\cite{Dravins_1981,Gray_2009}.
However, a precise measurement of the granulation pattern requires a understanding of the convective blueshift phenomenon.


\subsection{Convective Blueshift}
When the Sun pushes material up through its outer layer, the spectrum exhibits a blueshift. 
As this material subsequently cools and falls back through the atmosphere, it produces a redshift, but emits less light, making the blueshift dominant.

That can be measured by the relativistic Doppler effect. This effect accounts for length contraction, as predicted by Einstein’s theory of relativity. 
However, the measured negative redshift resulting from convective motions is known as \textit{convective blueshifts} which are measured by the Equation~\eqref{eq:relative velocity}. 
\begin{equation}
    v_r \approx c \parens{\frac{ \lambda_{obs}- \lambda_{rep}}{\lambda_{rep}}}
    \label{eq:relative velocity}
\end{equation}

Since the strength of the convective distortions and shifts of spectral lines vary across the H-R diagram, we expect systematic errors in radial velocities~\cite{Gray_2009}.

\subsection{Chromodependence characterization}
Recent emphasis on measuring the granulation pattern has led to new interpretations of line depth-dependent wavelength shifts.

Gray and others authors have cualitatively explained the line-depth dependence on convective blueshift.
Shallow lines come preferably from deep photospheric layers where convection is strong, so the convective blueshift is great.
As long as deep lines come preferably from superficial layers, where gravity has slowed the convection and the blueshift is small.
However, an explanation of why diagonal trend depends on color, or chromodependence along te line depth, has not been found.

In 2018, Gray and Oostra attempted to establish a standard curve determined by a third order polynomial fit to the solar granulation pattern (see Figure~\ref{fig:Gray standard curve}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Images/Standard curve gray.jpg}
    \caption{Standard curve proposed by Gray and Oostra on the spectral range the spectral range of $\SI{6020}{\angstrom}$ to $\SI{6340}{\angstrom}$. Image taken from~\cite{Gray_Oostra_2018}.}\label{fig:Gray standard curve}%
\end{figure}

Nevertheless, the authors limited the spectral range of $\SI{6020}{\angstrom}$ to $\SI{6340}{\angstrom}$, avoiding the chromodependence which becomes evident in a wider spectral range.
This limitation motivates the present work to develop a strong characterization and give the methodology for dealing with this phenomenon.

A separate theoretical perspective, offered by Hamilton and Lester, attributes aspects of photospheric dynamics to rotation.
The pronounced differential rotation with latitude observed seems to be the result of convective flows driven radially by the buoyancy force and deflected horizontally by the Coriolis force~\cite{Foukal_1990}.
This rotation contributes to angular momentum through two forms: Meridional circulation and Reynolds stresses.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Angular momentum.jpg}
    \caption{Contributions on angular momentum. Image taken from~\cite{Foukal_1990}.}\label{fig:angular momentum}%
\end{figure}

The first contribution involves axisymmetric meridional circulation (see Figure~\ref{fig:angular momentum}). 
In the absence of other transport mechanism, such a circulation would tend to spin up the poles and the interior, as the moving fluid conserves its angular momentum.

The second contribution, which tends to enforce solid body rotation, arises from Reynolds stresses associated with nonaxisymmetric convective motions.
The mechanism can be understood by considering that, for equal velocities in the meridional plane, the flux of angular momentum per unit mass is greater toward the equator than away from it. 
This process depends critically on nonaxisymmetric convection, as it generates net fluxes of angular momentum in latitudinal and radial directions without a corresponding net mass flux.
Neither buoyancy forces, which are strictly radial, nor pressure gradients, which must average to zero around the solar circumference, can directly influence the sun's axisymmetric rotation profile~\cite{Foukal_1990}.
Therefore, the combined action of meridional circulation and Reynolds stresses is essential for shaping the observed differential rotation.
