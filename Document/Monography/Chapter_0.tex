%------------------------------------------------------------------------ ABSTRACT AND ACKNOWLOGMENTS
\begin{abstract}
    For decades, the solar spectrum has served as the fundamental reference point for spectroscopic analysis. 
    As our nearest star, the Sun enables detailed studies of stellar composition. 
    However, advances in optical instrumentation have revealed previously undetected spectral details, providing new insights into fundamental solar properties.
    One key insight is the granulation patterns caused by convective motion, which are characterized by three distinct hydrodynamic signatures: Line broadening, line profile asymmetry, and the line-depth dependence of convective blueshift.

    Inspired by David Gray's foundational research, this project extracted the granulation patterns from the IAG Solar Flux Atlas to calculate relative velocities and perform a detailed analysis based on the three signatures of convection. 

    This project characterized the convective blueshift in solar absorption lines and the anomalous chromodependence present across the these signatures. 
    Specifically, we produced a refined, blend-free list of Fe I lines and derived solar granulation patterns with minimal scatter. 
    The analysis statistically justified a window of $\SI{1}{\miliangstrom}$ around the line core as the optimal width for examination, underscoring the accuracy and unprecedented precision of the IAG solar flux atlas. 

    Furthermore, we provided a detailed description of how granulation patterns vary with wavelength, establishing color-dependent standard granulation curves for the entire spectrum. 
    Our results determine that rotation is not the cause of the anomalous chromodependence observed in the third signature plot, and we established a general characterization for the full wavelength range of the atlas. 
    For the near-infrared, a general trend line describes the chromodependence, while the line bisector slope shift along the line depth is linear. 
    In the visible range, we identified individual granulation curves and a description for the coefficients.

\begin{abstract}

    I want to acknowledge everyone that helps and support me to keep in this place.
    Long time ago I was a younger girl who dreamed with stars and I thought that I never gonna reach that goal, cause Im not smart and Im a girl and why im gonna to throw up my future for that.
    Every person that I meet in the university give me a sight to keep with my dreams, this is my form to say thank you for believe in me.

    Specifically, i want to acknowledge sincerely to my asesor profesor Benjamin. 
    Not only to lead me in this project, for encourage me in a bad moment for my life and believe in me and my work.
    For always responses to the questions of a girl in first semester which only wants to see stars and know about spectrographs.
    Literally, for being in all my career, and listen me, my projects, my ideas and the thing that i get wrong even if he didnt be my profesor.
    He dont notice but he give me the purpose to believe in myslef and do physics to the end.


    To my Liebeleid, my lover, which supports and love unconditionally. 
    Who even when i didnt believe in myself he believes, and encourages me to take the step that i dont think ill gonna take.
    To my sister, for her, that she can see that is possible to do great things.
    To my friend, which support me along all the career and stay here, even the things dont seems to work out.
    For each person which give me force to do this crazy thing, even the one with is not anymore here.

    For the past me, we did it, we can see the stars now.
