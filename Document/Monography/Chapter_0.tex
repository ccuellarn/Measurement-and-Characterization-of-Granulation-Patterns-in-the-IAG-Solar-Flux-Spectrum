%------------------------------------------------------------------------ ABSTRACT AND ACKNOWLOGMENTS
\begin{abstract}
    For decades, the solar spectrum has served as the fundamental reference for stellar spectroscopic analysis. As our nearest star, the Sun provides a unique laboratory for understanding stellar physics, with granulation patterns from convective motion offering critical insights. These patterns are characterized by three key hydrodynamic signatures: line broadening, line profile asymmetry, and the line-depth dependence of convective blueshift.

Inspired by the foundational work of David Gray, this project presents a detailed characterization of convective blueshift and a newly identified anomalous chromodependence across these three signatures, using the high-precision IAG Solar Flux Atlas. We produced a refined, blend-free list of Fe I lines, from which granulation patterns were derived with minimal scatter. Our analysis statistically justifies a spectral window of $\SI{0.1}{\angstrom}$ around the line core as optimal for examination.

A major outcome is the establishment of color-dependent standard granulation curves across the solar spectrum. We demonstrate that the anomalous chromodependence—whereby shorter wavelength lines exhibit greater blueshifts and more positive bisector slopes for a given depth—is not caused by solar rotation. Furthermore, we provide a general characterization for the atlas's full wavelength range: a linear bisector slope shift with depth in the near-infrared, and distinct individual granulation curves in the visible. This work not only underscores the unparalleled quality of the IAG atlas but also delivers a refined framework and a public-ready line list for future stellar spectroscopic studies.
% For decades, the solar spectrum has served as a fundamental reference for spectroscopic analysis. 
% As our nearest star, the Sun enables detailed studies of stellar physics and composition. 
% Recent advances in optical instrumentation have revealed previously undetected spectral details, providing new insights into fundamental solar properties. 
% A key insight involves granulation patterns caused by convective motion, which are characterized by three distinct hydrodynamic signatures: line broadening, line profile asymmetry, and the line-depth dependence of convective blueshift.

% Inspired by David Gray's foundational research, this project extracted granulation patterns from the IAG Solar Flux Atlas to calculate relative velocities and perform a detailed analysis based on these three convective signatures.
% We characterized the convective blueshift in solar absorption lines and the anomalous chromodependence present across these signatures. 
% This involved producing a refined, blend-free list of Fe I lines and deriving solar granulation patterns with minimal scatter. 
% Our analysis statistically justified a window of $\SI{0.1}{\angstrom}$ around the line core as the optimal width for examination, underscoring the accuracy and unprecedented precision of the IAG Solar Flux Atlas.

% Furthermore, we provide a detailed description of how granulation patterns vary with wavelength, establishing color-dependent standard granulation curves for the entire spectrum. 
% Our results indicate that rotation is not the cause of the anomalous chromodependence observed in the third signature. 
% We also established a general characterization for the full wavelength range of the atlas: in the near-infrared, a general trend line describes the chromodependence, while the line bisector slope shift with depth is linear; in the visible range, we identified individual granulation curves and described their governing coefficients.

\begin{abstract}

I want to acknowledge everyone who has helped and supported me to reach this point.

A long time ago, I was a young girl who dreamed of the stars. 
I never thought I would reach that goal, because I thought I wasn't smart enough, and because I was afraid of throwing away my future on a dream. 
Every person I met at the university gave me a new perspective and the strength to keep pursuing my dreams. 
This is my way of saying thank you for believing in me.

Specifically, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Professor Benjamin. 
Thank you not only for guiding me through this project, but for encouraging me during a difficult time in my life and for believing in me and my work. 
Thank you for always responding to the questions of a first-semester girl who just wanted to look at the stars and learn about spectrographs. 
Literally, for being there throughout my entire degree, for listening to me, my projects, my ideas, and my mistakes, even when he wasn't my official professor. 
He may not realize it, but he gave me the purpose to believe in myself and to pursue physics to the end.

To my \textit{Liebeleid}, my lover, who supports and loves me unconditionally. 
Even when I didn't believe in myself, he did, and he encouraged me to take steps I never thought I would take.

To my sister, so that she can see that it is possible to achieve great things.

To Toto, who believed in me without a doubt and encouraged me to enter this career.
She is with the stars now, see the great things that she knew, cause she always knew everything, I can do.

To my friend Thomas, who supported me throughout my entire degree and stayed by my side, even when things didn't seem to be working out. 
Thank you for all the time shared on this Path of pain, and the coffe shared.

To every person who gave me the strength to do this crazy thing, family and friends, even those who are no longer here.

And to my past self: We did it. We can see the stars now.
