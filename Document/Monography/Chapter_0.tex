\begin{abstract}

This project presents a detailed characterization of convective blueshift and the anomalous chromodependence across the three signatures of convection: Line broadening, line asymmetry, and the line-depth dependence of convective blueshift.
This following the foundational work of David Gray (see~\cite{Gray_2009} and references therein). 
A primary outcome is a refined, blend-free list of Fe I lines, providing a community resource with measured convective blueshifts, line core curvatures, bisector slopes, excitation potentials, and damping coefficients. 
Our analysis statistically validates a $\SI{0.1}{\angstrom}$ window around the line core as optimal for analysis, confirming the methodology of Allende and Garcia~\cite{Allende_Garcia_1998}.

Furthermore, we establish color dependent standard granulation curves across the solar spectrum, confirming that deeper lines are found at shorter wavelengths. 
Specifically, we identify an anomalous chromodependence where, for a fixed line depth, shorter-wavelength lines exhibit greater convective blueshifts, higher core bisector slopes, and narrower profiles. 
We discarded solar rotation as the cause for this phenomenon, as this anomaly is more pronounced in the disk-center spectrum. 
The chromodependence is linear in the near infrared but requires individual curves in the visible range.

Quantitative analysis of line core curvature for shallow lines reveals a slope of $(1.83 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{10}\ \text{m}^{-1}$ for the disk-integrated flux, significantly lower than the $(2.94\pm 0.16)\times 10^{10}\ \text{m}^{-1}$ found at the disk-center. 
This translates to convective velocity values of $\langle v_{\text{conv}}^2 \rangle = 3.15\ (\text{km/s})^2$ and $2.20\ (\text{km/s})^2$, respectively, an unexpected inversion indicating complex convective dynamics. 
For line asymmetry in the $0.3-0.6$ range, bisector slopes decrease with wavelength in the integrated spectrum, with limb darkening causing non-uniform shifts. 
Analysis of line depth-dependence on excitation potential $(2.5$ - $5.0)$ eV shows a maximum displacement at $-200$ m/s for the integrated flux, shifting to $0$ m/s for the quiet sun atlas. 
This work provides a foundational dataset and suggests the development of an adaptive algorithm for future spectroscopic studies.

\begin{abstract}

% When I was younger, a girl who dreamed of the stars, achieving this goal once felt like a distant image.
% One rarely allowed myself to believe in, I was afraid of throwing away my future on a fantasy. 
% However, every professor and colleague I encountered at the university granted me a new perspective and the courage to persevere in the pursuit of my dreams.
% This works stands as a testament to their belief in me.

% I extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to my advisor, Professor Benjamin.
% I am deeply thankful not only for his guidance through this project but also, the encouragement he offered during a challenging period in my life.
% I am really grateful for the responses to the questions of a first-semester girl who just wanted to look at the stars and learn about spectrographs, always driving my curiosity to observe more the sky. 
% Literally, for his mentorship along my entire degree, listening to my projects, ideas, and even my mistakes. 
% And even more important, for the confidence to believe in myself.

% I wish to offer a special tribute to Toto, for her profound belief in me, which was the decisive touch I needed to embark on this career.
% Although she is now among the stars, I hope she witnesses the great things she always knew I could achieve.

% To my sister, with the hope that she may see in my achievement a reflection of her own potential to accomplish great things.

% To Daniel, my partner, for his unconditional love and support.
% He was a optimistal believer in my potential, even in my moments of uncertainty, and his support empowered me to pursue paths I once thought beyond my reach.

% To my friend Thomas, for his unwavering support and companionship throughout my degree, standing by me even during the most arduous moments.
% I thank him for his presence and for the many shared coffees that lightened the path.

% To all my family and friends, and to those no longer with us, who provided me with the strength to undertake this endeavor, thank you.

% Finally, to my younger self: \textit{We did it. We can see the stars.}
