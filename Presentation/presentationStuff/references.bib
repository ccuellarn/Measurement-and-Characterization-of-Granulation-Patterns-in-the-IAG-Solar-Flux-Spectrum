	abstract = {The edge illumination principle was first proposed at Elettra (Italy) in the late nineties, as an alternative method for achieving high phase sensitivity with a very simple and flexible set-up, and has since been under continuous development in the radiation physics group at {UCL}. Edge illumination allows overcoming most of the limitations of other phase-contrast techniques, enabling their translation into a laboratory environment. It is relatively insensitive to mechanical and thermal instabilities and it can be adapted to the divergent and polychromatic beams provided by X-ray tubes. This method has been demonstrated to work efficiently with source sizes up to 100m, compatible with state-of-the-art mammography sources. Two full prototypes have been built and are operational at {UCL}. Recent activity focused on applications such as breast and cartilage imaging, homeland security and detection of defects in composite materials. New methods such as phase retrieval, tomosynthesis and computed tomography algorithms are currently being theoretically and experimentally investigated. These results strongly indicate the technique as an extremely powerful and versatile tool for X-ray imaging in a wide range of applications.},

	abstract = {X-ray phase contrast imaging holds great promise for improving the visibility of light-element materials such as soft tissues and tumors. The single-mask differential phase contrast imaging method stands out as a simple and effective approach to yield differential phase contrast. In this work, we introduce a model for a single-mask phase imaging system based on the transport-of-intensity equation. Our model provides an accessible understanding of signal and contrast formation in single-mask x-ray phase imaging, offering a clear perspective on the image formation process, for example, the origin of alternate bright and dark fringes in phase contrast intensity images. Aided by our model, we present an efficient retrieval method that yields differential phase contrast imagery in a single acquisition step. Our model gives insight into the contrast generation and its dependence on the system geometry and imaging parameters in both the initial intensity image as well as retrieved images. The model validity as well as the proposed retrieval method are demonstrated via both experimental results on a system developed in house as well as Monte Carlo simulations. In conclusion, our work not only provides a model for an intuitive visualization of image formation but also offers a method to optimize differential phase imaging setups, holding tremendous promise for advancing medical diagnostics and other applications.},

The projection approximation is introduced, together with the concepts of attenuation contrast and phase contrast. We also outline the multi-slice approach to X-ray propagation through thick samples or optical elements, together with the Fresnel scaling theorem. Having introduced the fundamentals, we then consider several aspects of the forward problem, of modelling the formation of phase-contrast X-ray images. Several topics related to this forward problem are considered, including the transport-of-intensity equation, arbitrary linear imaging systems, shift-invariant linear imaging systems, the transfer-function formalism, blurring induced by finite source size, the space-frequency model for partially-coherent fields, and the Fokker-Planck equation for paraxial X-ray imaging. Having considered these means for modelling the formation of X-ray phase-contrast images, we then consider aspects of the associated inverse problem of phase retrieval.

	title = {Detector requirements for single mask edge illumination x-ray phase contrast imaging applications},
	abstract = {Edge illumination ({EI}) is a non-interferometric X-ray phase contrast imaging ({XPCI}) method that has been successfully implemented with conventional polychromatic sources, thanks to its relaxed coherence requirements. Like other {XPCI} methods, {EI} enables the retrieval of absorption, refraction and ultra-small angle X-ray scattering ({USAXS}) signals. However, current retrieval algorithms require three input frames, which have so far been acquired under as many different illumination conditions, in separate exposures. These illumination conditions can be achieved by deliberately misaligning the set-up in different ways. Each one of these misaligned configurations can then be used to record frames containing a mixture of the absorption, refraction and scattering signals. However, this acquisition scheme involves lengthy exposure times, which can also introduce errors to the retrieved signals. Such errors have, so far, been mitigated by careful image acquisition and analysis. However, further reduction to image acquisition time and errors due to sample mask/sample movement can increase the advantages offered by the {EI} technique, and enable targeting more challenging applications. In this paper, we describe two simplified set-ups that exploit state-of-the-art detector technologies to achieve single-shot multi-modal imaging.},

The code includes a custom X-ray refraction process and allows simulating the whole {EI} system, comprising a polychromatic and extended source, absorbing masks, substrates, their movement during acquisition, and X-ray detection. In this paper, a realistic spectral detector model is introduced and its energy response validated against experimental data acquired with synchrotron radiation at energies between 26 and 50 {keV}. Moreover, refraction and transmission images of a plastic phantom are reconstructed from simulation data and successfully compared with theoretical predictions. Finally, an optimization study aiming at finding the effect of the X-ray focal spot size (i.e. spatial coherence) on image quality is presented; the results suggest that, in the considered configuration, the system can tolerate source sizes up to 30 μm, while, for a fixed exposure time, the best signal-to-noise ratio in refraction images is found for source sizes in the order of 10 to 15 μm.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new flexible compact multi-modal imaging setup referred to as {PEPI} (Photon-counting Edge-illumination Phase-contrast imaging) Lab, which is based on the edge-illumination ({EI}) technique and a chromatic detector. The system enables both X-ray phase-contrast ({XPCI}) and spectral ({XSI}) imaging of samples on the centimeter scale. This work conceptually follows all the stages in its realization, from the design to the first imaging results. The setup can be operated in four different modes, i.e. photon-counting/conventional, spectral, double-mask {EI}, and single-mask {EI}, whereby the switch to any modality is fast, software controlled, and does not require any hardware modification or lengthy re-alignment procedures. The system specifications, ranging from the X-ray tube features to the mask material and aspect ratio, have been quantitatively studied and optimized through a dedicated Geant4 simulation platform, guiding the choice of the instrumentation. The realization of the imaging setup, both in terms of hardware and control software, is detailed and discussed with a focus on practical/experimental aspects. Flexibility and compactness (66 cm source-to-detector distance in {EI}) are ensured by dedicated motion stages, whereas spectral capabilities are enabled by the Pixirad-1/Pixie-{III} detector in combination with a tungsten anode X-ray source operating in the range 40–100 {kVp}. The stability of the system, when operated in {EI}, has been verified, and drifts leading to mask misalignment of less than 1 \$\${\textbackslash}upmu\$\$m have been measured over a period of 54 h. The first imaging results, one for each modality, demonstrate that the system fulfills its design requirements. Specifically, {XSI} tomographic images of an iodine-based phantom demonstrate the system’s quantitativeness and sensibility to concentrations in the order of a few mg/ml. Planar {XPCI} images of a carpenter bee specimen, both in single and double-mask modes, demonstrate that refraction sensitivity (below 0.6 \$\${\textbackslash}upmu\$\$rad in double-mask mode) is comparable with other {XPCI} systems based on microfocus sources. Phase {CT} capabilities have also been tested on a dedicated plastic phantom, where the phase channel yielded a 15-fold higher signal-to-noise ratio with respect to attenuation.},

Using different retrieval algorithms, information about an object’s attenuation, refraction, and scattering properties can be obtained. In recent years, a theoretical framework has been developed that enables {EI} computed tomography ({CT}) and, hence, three-dimensional imaging. This review provides a summary of these advances, covering the development of different image acquisition schemes, retrieval approaches, and applications.

Its ability to reveal object features that had so far been considered invisible to x-rays immediately suggested great potential for applications across the life and the physical sciences, and an increasing number of groups worldwide started experimenting with it. At that time, it looked like a synchrotron facility was strictly necessary to perform {XPCI} with some degree of efficiency—the only alternative being micro-focal sources, the limited flux of which imposed excessively long exposure times. However, new approaches emerged in the mid-00s that overcame this limitation, and allowed {XPCI} implementations with conventional, non-micro-focal x-ray sources. One of these approaches showing particular promise for ‘real-world’ applications is edge-illumination {XPCI}: this article describes the key steps in its evolution in the context of contemporary developments in {XPCI} research, and presents its current state-of-the-art, especially in terms of transition towards practical applications.},

	abstract = {Multi-modal X-ray imaging allows the extraction of phase and dark-field (or “Ultra-small Angle Scatter”) images alongside conventional attenuation ones. Recently, scan-based systems using conventional sources that can simultaneously output the above three images on relatively large-size objects have been developed by various groups. One limitation is the need for some degree of spatial coherence, achieved either through the use of microfocal sources, or by placing an absorption grating in front of an extended source. Both these solutions limit the amount of flux available for imaging, with the latter also leading to a more complex setup with additional alignment requirements. Edge-illumination partly overcomes this as it was proven to work with focal spots of up to 100 micron. While high-flux, 100 micron focal spot sources do exist, their comparatively large footprint and high cost can be obstacles to widespread translation. A simple solution consists in placing a single slit in front of a large focal spot source. We used a tunable slit to study the system performance at various effective focal spot sizes, by extracting transmission, phase and dark-field images of the same specimens for a range of slit widths. We show that consistent, repeatable results are obtained for varying X-ray statistics and effective focal spot sizes. As the slit width is increased, the expected reduction in the raw differential phase peaks is observed, compensated for in the retrieval process by a broadened sensitivity function. This leads to the same values being correctly retrieved, but with a slightly larger error bar i.e. a reduction in phase sensitivity. Concurrently, a slight increase in the dark-field signal is also observed.},

ABSTRACT = {Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed neoplasm in women in Italy. There are several risk factors, but thanks to screening and increased awareness, most breast cancers are diagnosed at an early stage when surgical treatment can most often be conservative and the adopted therapy is more effective. Regular screening is essential but advanced technology is needed to achieve quality diagnoses. Mammography is the gold standard for early detection of breast cancer. It is a specialized technique for detecting breast cancer and, thus, distinguishing normal tissue from cancerous breast tissue. Mammography techniques are based on physical principles: through the proper use of X-rays, the structures of different tissues can be observed. This first part of the paper attempts to explain the physical principles used in mammography. In particular, we will see how a mammogram is composed and what physical principles are used to obtain diagnostic images.},

	abstract = {X-ray imaging, traditionally relying on attenuation contrast, struggles to differentiate materials with similar attenuation coefficients like soft tissues. X-ray phase contrast imaging ({XPCI}) and dark-field ({DF}) imaging provide enhanced contrast by detecting phase shifts and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering ({USAXS}). However, they typically require complex and costly setups, along with multiple exposures to retrieve various contrast features. In this study, we introduce a novel single-mask X-ray imaging system design that simultaneously captures attenuation, differential phase contrast ({DPC}), and dark-field images in a single exposure. Most importantly, our proposed system design requires just a single mask alignment with relatively low-resolution detectors. Using our novel light transport models derived for these specific system designs, we show intuitive understanding of contrast formation and retrieval method of different contrast features. Our approach eliminates the need for highly coherent X-ray sources, ultra-high-resolution detectors, spectral detectors or intricate gratings. We propose three variations of the single-mask setup, each optimized for different contrast types, offering flexibility and efficiency in a variety of applications. The versatility of this single-mask approach along with the use of befitting light transport models holds promise for broader use in clinical diagnostics and industrial inspection, making advanced X-ray imaging more accessible and cost-effective.},
